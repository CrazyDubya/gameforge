// A byte-for-byte copy of src/bot.c as it stood at the start of v4, renamed so
// both can be linked at once. It is never edited again, and that is the whole
// point: when the working bot changes, this one holds the game fixed, so a
// moved win rate can be attributed to the change rather than to the observer.
//
// It plays badly. It samples prices once per keypress, its hire test is a
// tautology, and it never runs short of hold space. A control does not need to
// be good, it needs to be constant.
//
// Caveat: it calls world_crew_price and world_upg_price, so a phase that
// reprices kit WILL move it. It is a control for changes to the agent, not an
// absolute yardstick.
//
// Edited once since being frozen, in v6 P1, to add three world_stock guards to
// its buy paths -- and recorded here because an unexplained edit to a control
// is worse than no control. It is not a strategy change: finite stock makes
// world_buy fail silently, and an agent that presses BUY at an empty stall
// runs to the step cap and stalls. A frozen reference that cannot finish a run
// measures nothing.
//
// The consequence is that -A ref is NOT a valid control for P1 itself, only
// for the phases after it. Both arms of P1 had to change for either to run.
// convoy -- a price-aware test bot.
//
// This is NOT part of the game. It is compiled only into the headless harness,
// so it contributes zero bytes to the submitted executable.
//
// It exists because scripted key sequences can only measure the floor: a fixed
// string of presses cannot look at a price and decide. This bot plays through
// the same UI a human uses -- moving the cursor, pressing the same keys -- and
// makes decisions from the world state, which is what makes it possible to ask
// whether the game rewards playing well.
