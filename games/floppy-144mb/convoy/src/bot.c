// -- prices, burn rates, capacities, what is reachable -- and never a
// *valuation*. It must not call world_upg_payback or world_crew_payback.
//
// Not a style preference. world_upg_price is defined as a fixed percentage of
// world_upg_payback, so a test of the form `payback(x) > price(x)` reduces to
// `p > 0.45p`, which is true for every positive p. That was literally the
// hiring test: it passed for any crew member at any price, whether the payback
// figure behind it was right or wrong by a factor of eight. A tautology cannot
// discover that a price is wrong, and the price being wrong is the thing under
// investigation.
//

// prices it has paid, the encounters it has met, the times it ran out of room.

//     honest                       39%
//     every rumour forced FALSE    38%

// slightly worse than ignoring it. Three separate claim sets were tried --
// uniform, biased toward survival goods, and biased toward what the map does
// not already imply -- and none of them moved the number.
//
// The reason is not the claims, it is the map. A hop offers two or three nodes
// in the next sector, and they are near enough interchangeable that knowing
// more about one cannot pay: score_node already prefers a well when the tank is
// low, and the archetype is drawn on screen. This is v5's crew problem wearing

// matter however strong it was; here, a choice between near-identical options
// cannot be informed however good the information is.

// and not to rumours, so it is not this phase's to make. Recorded rather than
// tuned until a number appeared.

// a player -- and never `truth`. A bot that can see whether a rumour is true
// scores perfectly against information nobody has, and the -I 1 against -I 0
