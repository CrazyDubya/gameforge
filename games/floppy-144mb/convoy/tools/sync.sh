# /home/opc/144mb/convoy is what actually ships and what CI builds. They are
# two separate copies with no link between them, so for three releases the
# only thing keeping them in step was remembering to cp by hand. Nothing would
# have reported a drift: the tested binary and the shipped binary are built
# from different files, and every sweep runs against the former.
#
# Run this before every commit. It reports what it changed rather than copying
# silently, because a sync that quietly overwrites is how work gets lost.
