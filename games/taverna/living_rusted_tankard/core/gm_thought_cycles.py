🧠 GM THINKING GOALS:
1. Plan interesting events for the future
2. Consider how NPCs should react to player behavior
3. Think about story progression opportunities
4. Plan atmosphere changes or world events
5. Consider what the player might need or want

💭 THOUGHT TYPES:
- IMMEDIATE: React to recent player actions (spawn NPC, trigger event)
- IMPORTANT: Plan major story beats or character moments
- BACKGROUND: Develop world atmosphere, NPC personalities

Generate ONE specific, actionable thought as JSON:
{{
  "priority": "immediate|important|background",
  "content": "What you're thinking about doing",
  "action_type": "spawn_npc|trigger_event|modify_atmosphere|plan_story|update_npc",
  "details": {{"specific": "implementation details"}},
  "reasoning": "Why this is important now"
