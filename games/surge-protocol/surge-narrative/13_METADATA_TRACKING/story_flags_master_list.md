# Story Flags Master List

## Purpose

This document tracks all story flags used across Surge Protocol's narrative content. Story flags are boolean or integer values that track player choices, relationships, progress, and world state.

**Usage**: When writing quests or dialogue, reference these flags for consistency. When creating new flags, add them to this list.

## Flag Naming Conventions

### Boolean Flags

- Use adjectives for states: `ROSA_ROMANCE_ACTIVE`, `HUMANITY_FROZEN`

### Integer Flags
- Relationships: -100 to +100 (negative = hostile, positive = friendly)
- Scores: 0 to 100 (Humanity, augmentation percentage)
- Counts: 0+ (streak counters, completion counts)
- Stages: 1-5 or 0-10 (progression steps)

### String Flags
- Use lowercase with underscores: "self_funded", "delivered_blind"
- Limited set of values for each flag (enum-style)
- Document possible values in this list

---

## Cross-Reference Guidelines

When writing new content:

1. **Check existing flags** before creating new ones
2. **Use consistent naming** (follow conventions above)
3. **Document new flags** in this list immediately
4. **Consider dependencies** - which flags gate which content?
5. **Track consequences** - flag changes should ripple through story

### Example Flag Dependencies

**To access Third Path ending**:
- `MET_SOLOMON` = true
- `HUMANITY_SCORE` > 20
- `ALGORITHM_INTEGRATED` = true
- `CHOSE_THIRD_PATH` = true
- Optional: `FORKED` = true (adds complexity)

**To achieve Rosa romance ending**:
- `ROSA_ROMANCE_ACTIVE` = true
- `ROSA_ROMANCE_STAGE` >= 4
- `CHOSE_ROGUE` = true
- `ROSA_CHOSEN` = true (if ultimatum given)
- `HUMANITY_SCORE` > 60

**To become The Hollow**:
- `HUMANITY_SCORE` = 0
- `ALGORITHM_INTEGRATED` = true
- Results in: `CHOSE_ASCENSION` = true (automatic)

---

## Implementation Notes for Developers

### Flag Storage
- Store in persistent player save file
- Boolean: 1 byte
- Integer: 4 bytes
- String: Variable (use enums/indices for efficiency)

### Flag Checking
- Check flags at conversation start, quest start, scene load
- Cache flag values for performance (don't query every frame)
- Update flags immediately when choices made

### Flag Display (Optional)
- Debug menu showing all active flags
- Story log showing major choices and their flags
- Relationship screen showing NPC values

### Flag Reset/Testing
- Dev mode to set flags for testing specific scenarios
- Save game editor for QA testing
- Flag change logs for debugging
